# My Brew config
This repo contains a quickstart setup to install Homebrew and set up all the applications I need and use for my day-to-day work and usage.

The idea is to use this to serve a new machine to quickly get started to work. Feel free to adjust and use it for yourself!

To get started, you can use the following install script using **cUrl**:
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AChris07/brew-config/master/install.sh | bash
```

or **wget**:
```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AChris07/brew-config/master/install.sh | bash
```
